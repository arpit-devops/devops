EKS security notes:-
container are process sharing common kernel, isolated by namespace and cgroup, 
an attacker can breach namespace and can access host 

Hosts --> CIS benchmark, deploy node on private subnet
container images --> ecr scanning on push, use apline, run user as non-root.
IAM --> use IRSA to pod instead of giving permission to EC2, EKS endpoint private, 
Network --> enable network policy --> restricting east-west traffic like ingress and egress for pod and to which port. start with denied all, create SG for node. service to service traffic encryption using mesh.
auditing and forensic (after pod kill do analysis) --> enable control plane logs, cloud trails log
configuration --> password, vault, params
data --> data at rest and transit --> GDPR
source code --> static code analysis 
Pod and runtime:- we can introduce PSP:-  now Pod Security Admission (PSA) from eks 1.25
	--> deny privilage esclaration within pod.
	--> deny running as root.
	--> deny mounting host path
	--> drop linux capability
