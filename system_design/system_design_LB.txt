Type of Load balancing:
**********************
1. DNS Load Balancer
2. Hardware LB
3. Software LB
4. Global server Load balancing

General Attribute of load balancer:-
***********************************
1. Scalability           	--> we can horizontally scale our server behind load balancer.
2. High Availability     	--> it healthcheck for server behind lb, if server is down it send traffic to another server 
3. Perfromance (Thoughput)	--> performance might little decrease because traffic reach server via LB 
4. Maintanability               --> it help in server maintability as to cut server and attached.

DNS LB:-
******
suppose we have 3 server with ip address 123.12.12.3, 123.12.12.4, 123.12.12.5.
we take DNS like myweb.com  and it is matched with these three IP address. it will send request one by one to each server like round-robin.
super simple and cheap

drawback:-
if one server fail it still send traffic to this server only. 
it expose direct IP for our server. security issue.

to remove this drawback use H/W or S/W LB.


H/W or S/W LB:-
*************

<check general attribute of LB>

it is use as internal LB as well to route traffic between many Backend server.

drawback:-
this LB should be Co-located with server, because if we have 5-5 server in different localtion (data centre/region) with LB it leads to latency.

we still need DNS resolution

to remove this drawback we use GSLB - Global server load balancer.

GSLB - Global server load balancer:-
***********************************

1.this is intellegent to send traffic to server near to geographical location based on CPU load in Data centre, response time, Bandwidth.

2. This also resolve DNS for us.

Also very helpful in disaster recovery situation. if one data centre down it will send traffic to another Data centre.
