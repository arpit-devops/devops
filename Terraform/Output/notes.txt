  for_each            = var.platforms
  name                = "nrql-${each.key}-${var.env}"
  incident_preference = "PER_CONDITION"
}

output block :--

  value = newrelic_alert_policy.platform_alert[*]
}


1. Output have "value" as an attribute which is going to printed
2. this will output you correct object values and what attributes it contains. you can filter our attributes inside this output.
like after tf plan we can say :- newrelic_alert_policy.platform_alert[*].apg.name   --> is a valid key.

3. output block does not have for_each attribute it has "*" or kind of json parsing
